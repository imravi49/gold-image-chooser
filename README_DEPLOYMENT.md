## ✅ Security Complete - Production Ready

All critical security vulnerabilities have been resolved. The app is now fully secured with:

- ✅ Secure admin_settings (admin-only RLS policies)
- ✅ Proper password management via Supabase Auth
- ✅ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Complete RLS policies on all tables
- ✅ Secure logo storage in Supabase Storage
- ✅ Edge Function for privileged operations
- ✅ Activity logging with proper policies

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Environment variables auto-configured by Lovable Cloud

2. **Create Admin User**
   ```sql
   -- After signing up at your app, run in Lovable Cloud SQL Editor:
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
   VALUES ('your-user-id', 'admin'::app_role);
   ```

3. **Enable Password Protection** (Recommended)
   - Lovable Cloud → Authentication → Settings
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
