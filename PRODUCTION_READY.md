- Auth: Supabase Auth
- Storage: Supabase Storage
- Realtime: Supabase Realtime

### Firebase Mode (Automatic Switch)
Add these environment variables to automatically switch to Firebase:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

The app will automatically detect Firebase credentials and switch backends without code changes.
